Great scott! Delorean(tm) is the hottest time travel rideshare startup in
town. However, its engineers are suffering a serious case of the
blues with this bad boy of a monolith.

All hope is not lost, though! With the powers of Domain Driven
Design, we're going to work through this idiomatic Rails ball of mud and
push it far, far into the future.
